# GRAB-AI.For.SEA-challenge
This is a submission for GRAB AI For SEA challenge - computer vision


Accuracy achieved is approx. 89% on valididation data and 76% on test data so fine-tuning is still needed. Model used is Densenet121.

To process and split the data into train, validation and test, use the Preprocess.ipynb
To train the model, use train.ipynb
To test the model, use test.ipynb

All documentation is inside the notebooks, so you should be able to understand what each line of code does.
